<h1 style="margin: auto; text-align: center;"> What's up! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

I'm Joey, a Southern California resident and student at the University of California, Irvine. I'm majoring in Computer Engineering and love programming outside of schoolwork. I'm also interested in chip design, and planning to pursue a PhD in the area of Integrated Circuits or Computer Architecture.

### Some Info About Me
- I love building computers, I've built 9 so far!
- The first programming language I learned was Python.
- I enjoy running, surfing, and playing guitar in my free time.

### Places I've Worked
- Cisco Systems
  - Hardware Engineer Intern | June 2022 - September 2022 (3 months)
  - Hardware Engineer Intern | June 2023 - Current (18 months)

### Hardware Experience
- Processor Architecture
  - Scalar, 5-stage pipeline RISC-V and MIPS32 designs (EECS 112/112L)
  - Vector Processor, implements RISC-V ISA (Research at UC Irvine)
- Embedded programming
  - TI Microcontrollers (MSP430)
  - ST Microcontrollers (STM32L431)
  - ESP32 Microcontrollers (ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3)
  - Arduino (UNO R4, Nano 33 BLE)
- General knowledge of PCB design

### Software Experience
- C/C++ - dynamic memory, makefiles, structs/classes, sockets, GUIs, processes, process memory manipulation (game hacking), threads, embedded firmware development, I2C/SPI
- Java - inheritance, event buses/handling, Spigot plugins
- Python - JSON, APIs, classes, inheritance, sockets, serial, regex, data analysis (with matplotlib, etc.), digital signal processing (fft, signal filters, etc.), threads
- Assembly (x86) - general knowledge of the instruction set (learned from game hacking)
- Assembly (RISC-V) - general knowledge of instruction set (learned in class, EECS 112)
- Assembly (MIPS32) - general knowledge of instruction set (learned in class, EECS 112L)

### Currently Working On
- striker (my third chess engine in C)

### Potential Future Projects
- 16-bit processor design (Verilog/SystemVerilog)
